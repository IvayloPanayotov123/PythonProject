python manage.py setup_admin_groups

This will setup admin groups Merchants and Suppliers(previously named Marketeers but sounded illogical so changed it)

python manage.py setup_staff_accounts

will create staff accounts with usernames Trayan(suppliers) and Nikola(Merchants), each with a password of ManThe21st

Suppliers are supposed to change/add/delete available parts for creation of computers

Merchants can confirm/deliver orders
